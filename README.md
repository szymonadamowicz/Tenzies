# Tenzies React App

## Overview
This is a simple React application called "Tenzies" that allows users to play a dice game. The goal of the game is to roll the dice until all dice show the same value. Players can click on each die to freeze its current value between rolls.

## How to Play
1. Click the dice to freeze or unfreeze them.
2. Roll the dice by clicking the "Roll" button.
3. Keep rolling until all dice show the same value.
4. If successful, the game will indicate "Tenzies," and you can start a new game.
